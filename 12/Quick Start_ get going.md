# Quick Start: get going

> **::Hello and welcome!::**

> Writing should be fun, simple and writing tools should get out of the way. Craft is there to make this happen and help you ‘Craft’ your document.



### Craft isn’t your standard note taking app

You probably tried dozens of apps before you found Craft - so what makes us different?

**::Craft is easy.::** Just open, write and share - no interruptions, no heavy-lifting, no laptop throwing.

**::Craft is flexible.::** Personalize to your heart’s content - you run the app, not the other way round.

**::Craft is comprehensive.::** Personal wikis, monthly planners, sales reports, client proposals - create beautiful content that makes a big impression.

**::Craft is clever.::** Simple intuitive features make styling and formatting a breeze.



### I’M READY!
